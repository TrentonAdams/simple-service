<p>This jsp page was referenced by <strong>convention</strong>. Namely that
  it's at
  <strong>com/example/NewService/index.jsp</strong>, which is what the
  template referred to without a leading '/'. The convention, when no
  leading slash is specified on the template name (e.g. @Template("index.jsp")),
  is to construct a path, using the class' package name and class name, as the
  location that Jersey expects your jsp files to be in.
